  <h1>IBD's 100 Best ESG Companies For 2023</h1>
  <p>Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) pressures for companies are rising quickly due to regulatory pressure and volatile events. Investors need to know where to find the best ESG stocks, as ESG insights provide a critical view on the risk and resilience of a business.</p>
  
  <div class="criteria">
    <h2>Selection Criteria</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Initial List:</strong> Started with Dow Jones' ESG sustainability scores for over 6,000 global companies.</li>
      <li><strong>Score Analysis:</strong> Combined publicly available data with media coverage analysis.</li>
      <li><strong>Filtering:</strong> Narrowed down from 2,067 U.S.-traded companies to 1,559 by removing nonpublic companies, those with stock prices below $10, and those lacking sufficient data for an IBD Composite Rating.</li>
      <li><strong>Performance Requirement:</strong> Companies must meet or beat the S&P 500 performance over the past five years.</li>
      <li><strong>IBD Composite Rating:</strong> Selected the top 100 companies with the highest IBD Composite Rating, all scoring 81 or better.</li>
      <li><strong>Tie-Breaking:</strong> Used Relative Strength Rating and EPS Rating to break any ties.</li>
      <li><strong>Final Ranking:</strong> Ranked the 100 companies by Dow Jones' ESG score, using the IBD Composite Rating to break ties.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <p>These steps ensure that the companies on the list are not only ESG standouts but also have strong technical and fundamental stock ratings.</p>
